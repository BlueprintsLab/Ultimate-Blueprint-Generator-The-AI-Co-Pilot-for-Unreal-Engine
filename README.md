Version 0.1.0 is a groundbreaking update, transforming the plugin into a complete AI Copilot for Unreal Engine. Featuring full Model Control Protocol (MCP) integration, you can now connect directly to AI clients like Cursor and Claude Desktop for a seamless, conversational workflow.

Key New Features:
- Project-Wide Intelligence: Scan your entire project to create a knowledge base. The AI can now generate detailed performance/memory reports and answer high-level questions like, "Where is the health system implemented?"
- Advanced Scene Population: Instantly populate selected volumes or areas with hundreds of Static Meshes and Blueprints, featuring full randomization for location, rotation, and scale.
- Complete UI (UMG) Scaffolding: Build and lay out complex UI hierarchies from a single prompt. The AI can create panels, buttons, and text, and control layout properties like anchors, alignment, and padding.
- Conversational Code Refactoring: Select any Blueprint nodes and get a safe, non-destructive, optimized function as a suggested replacement.
- Context-Aware Workflow: The AI is now aware of your context. It can create assets in your currently focused Content Browser folder and use actors selected in the level as spawn boundaries.
- Expanded Asset & Scene Control: Full support has been added for creating Materials, applying them to multiple actors, and spawning any actor type. The AI can also list and select actors in the World Outliner.
- Complex System Generation: Scaffold entire gameplay systems (e.g., a complete Health system with damage/heal functions) from a single high-level command.

Have you ever felt stuck?

You know what you want to build, but you're lost in a sea of nodes. You've watched hours of tutorials, but the logic still doesn't click. Or maybe you're a seasoned dev, tired of wiring the same boilerplate for the tenth time while a brilliant idea fades from your mind.

We've all been there. That's why we built this.

This tool was born from a simple idea: to break down the barriers between a creative vision and its technical implementation. It's the ultimate learning aid, the ultimate prototyper, and the ultimate time-saver. It's the tool we wish we had when we were starting out.

Why This is an Essential Investment in Your Workflow

💬 A True AI Partner, Not Just a Generator.

The conversation has changed. You can now select a node in your graph and ask the AI to add logic directly after it. It feels less like a command line and more like a collaboration. Got a confusing Blueprint from the marketplace? Just take a screenshot and ask the AI to explain it. It's a revolutionary way to learn and refactor code.

🧠 Think in Your Language. Create in Unreal.

It’s not just a translation tool. It’s about thinking in your native language, be it English, Spanish, German, Chinese, or more and seeing your ideas come to life without that mental barrier. The AI understands intent, not just words.

⚡ The Fastest Way to Master Blueprints.

Stop guessing. Stop forming bad habits. This tool is like a 24/7 senior developer on your shoulder, showing you the "right way" to build logic. You'll finally understand why things work the way they do, turning a steep learning curve into an upward launch.

🔌 Unprecedented Flexibility & Power.

Your AI, your choice. We've massively expanded our support to include the most powerful models on the market. Use the creativity of Claude, the reliability of OpenAI, or the generous free tier of Google Gemini. (The results are the same among all AI Providers)

Coming Soon: The Future is Local. 
We are actively developing and testing Local LLM support via Ollama. This is our highest priority and will be coming in a future update, allowing for completely private, secure, and cost-free generation. Your purchase today guarantees you'll get this game-changing feature the moment it's ready.

❗Important Information & Disclaimer

This is a Beta Release: You are joining us on the ground floor. While the core features are stable and powerful, bugs may occur. Your feedback and bug reports are invaluable and will directly shape the future of this tool.
